# Giovanni Bassi's Navi Cheats

Main repo: [codeberg.org/giggio/cheats](https://codeberg.org/giggio/cheats)

These are my cheatsheets for [Navi](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi).

They are tagged by Shell and OS if they are specific to that environment.

## Installation

Do:

````bash
navi repo add https://codeberg.org/giggio/cheats.git
````

See
[Navi docs](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi/blob/master/docs/cheatsheet_repositories.md#importing-cheatsheets)
for more information.

**Note**: There is a `build.sh` script that will separate the files in directories, categorizing them by
Operating System and Shell. It could be useful if you don't want all the cheats, just the ones for your shell.
You won't be able to use `navi repo add` if you do that.
